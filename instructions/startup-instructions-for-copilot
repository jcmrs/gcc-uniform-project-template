# Starting Instructions for Copilot

## Project Goal
Create a uniform base template project for integrating Claude.AI and Copilot with GitHub for project management, technical development, and workflow automation. This template will be used as a starting point for future projects and can be tailored as needed.

## Desired Workflow
- Claude.AI acts as Project Manager, Prompt Designer, and documentation specialist.
- Copilot acts as Lead Developer, Automation Specialist, and technical reviewer.
- Both collaborate through GitHub by using issues, handoff templates, documentation files, and process protocols.
- Handoff and context are managed using Markdown files and JSON state files in the repository.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- Claude.AI: Project planning, issue creation, protocol documentation, context handoff, summarization, and coordination.
- Copilot: Technical implementation, code writing, workflow automation, review, and updating documentation/templates.

## Key Constraints
- Uniform template project.
- GDPR, medical sector, no-code, automation friendly.
- All other constraints to be added by future project forks.

## Repository Structure Preferences
- `docs/` for documentation and protocols.
- `handoffs/` for handoff templates and session summaries.
- `roles/` for role definitions and frameworks.
- `templates/` for workflow and issue templates.
- `project-state.json` for persistent project state.
- `README.md` for project overview.

## Starting Tasks
- Generate initial documentation files and repo structure.
- Draft initial issues for project milestones, handoff protocol, and role-switching guidelines.
- Provide guidance on interacting with Claude.AI for project management and Copilot for technical execution.

## References
- Include all generated templates, frameworks, and protocols in the repository for use in future projects.
