## THIS IS THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN COPILOT AND USER WHICH PROVIDED THE INITIAL CONCEPT FOR PROJECT

I'm primarly lookin for open source projects. I am trying to create my own approach (@jcmrs/claude-github-mcp-server-integration) but I am facing some issues. 

I'm solely looking at integrating Claude.AI and Github, because even though I have a Claude.AI Pro Plan I keep hitting Token / Message Length constraints. A prime reason of why I started my own project was that passing / handing over information from one Conversation to a next (or parallel Conversations, with one focusing on Artifact or code creation, the other on feature development or project management) was impossible, and because when Claude.AI creates files (local and remote) it very quickly encounters message length constraints, resulting in broken artifacts and partial documents. 

Yes, I would love if you could search. I'm only human so I am in need of support here, due to the complexities and especially because I am not that technical myself so I am likely to not be familiar with or use the same language actual developers use. And that is something you do understand.

Here are some open source projects and resources that specifically focus on integrating Claude.AI with GitHub, and may offer solutions to the token/message length constraints, conversation handoff, and artifact creation issues you described:

Claudable

An open-source web builder that leverages local CLI agents (like Claude Code and Cursor Agent) for building and deploying products. It may support workflows that could help with artifact creation and managing message constraints.
GitHub: opactorai/Claudable
Claude Code GitHub Actions (by Anthropic)

Provides AI-powered automation for GitHub workflows. You can mention @claude in PRs/issues to analyze code, create PRs, implement features, and fix bugs. This could help manage project development and possibly enable code handoff between sessions.
Docs: Claude Code GitHub Actions
Claude Hub Project

A GitHub webhook service bringing Claude AI directly into your development workflow. This is designed for integration and could have features supporting session or artifact handoff.
Docs: Claude Hub Project
Claude Code Tools Deep Dive

A blog post reviewing 17 code-related open-source projects in the ClaudeCode ecosystem, which may include tools specifically addressing the constraints and handoff issues you mentioned.
Review: Hardcore Tested GitHub’s Top 17 Claude Code Tools
GitHub API Integration in Claude Code Action

Technical documentation explaining how Claude Code Action uses GitHub’s API for deep context, which could help with conversation handover and artifact management.
DeepWiki: GitHub API Integration | anthropics/claude-code-action
These resources and projects should give you a strong starting point. They’re open source, actively maintained, and directly address many of the pain points you described. If you want recommendations based on your specific workflow or need technical help setting up one of these solutions, let me know!

You said: Ah, I see some confusion. These focus
Ah, I see some confusion. These focus on Claude Code. 
This is a commercial and parallel product by Anthropic. It can connect with Claude.AI, but it is not the same as. 

I am poor. So I cannot use Claude Code. Hence my focus on Claude.AI.
Copilot said: Thank you for clarifying! You’re specifically looking
Thank you for clarifying! You’re specifically looking for open source projects that integrate Claude.AI (the consumer-facing conversational assistant, not Claude Code or enterprise/commercial APIs) with GitHub, and that help overcome limitations around:

Token and message length constraints
Passing information or context between conversations (handoff, continuity)
Artifact/code creation without breaking due to message size limits
And you want solutions that are free/open source and do not depend on Claude Code (which is a paid/enterprise offering).

Next steps:

I’ll focus only on Claude.AI (the web-based/chatbot product) integrations or workarounds.
I’ll look for projects, scripts, or community solutions that help bridge Claude.AI with GitHub, especially ones that address your pain points on context handoff, artifact creation, and session continuity.
I’ll avoid any commercial/paid/enterprise Claude Code products.
Would you like:

A list of existing open source projects/scripts (if any) that do this?
Or help brainstorming or designing your own approach if the ecosystem is still new?
Let me know if you want me to search for existing solutions, or if your repo is already a pioneering effort and you’d like technical help designing workarounds for these issues!

You said: I would like to see a list
I would like to see a list yes. 

But I would also appreciate feedback / brainstorm, yes. Especially because my current project is like a race between development and constraints. It may well be possible that what I am looking to create is not feasible, so I might have to consider compromises. Or, this is also possible, my angle of approach may be wrong. 

In simple terms: I depend on AI to manage projects + document + develop application/code. As Claude.AI has specific constraints, I started to look at splitting this across Conversations within Claude.AI Project (the feature). What I have works, but it is probably clumsy.

Copilot said: Here’s a list of open source and
Here’s a list of open source and free projects/resources that focus on integrating Claude.AI (the chatbot—not Claude Code) with GitHub for project management, documentation, and code development, and which may help with message length constraints and session handoff:

1. GitHub Integration in Claude.AI
You can connect your GitHub repositories directly to Claude.AI for better context in software development tasks. This is a built-in feature, not a separate project, but it’s relevant for your workflow.
Guide: Using the GitHub Integration | Anthropic Help Center
2. Opencoder
An open source alternative to Claude Code, but focused on integrating AI agents with GitHub. May help with project management and workflow automation using Claude.AI.
GitHub: ducan-ne/opencoder
3. LobeChat
A free, open source chat platform that offers Claude AI Artifacts-like functionality (code generation, charts, etc.), and is positioned as an alternative for users seeking more flexibility and control.
Blog: Open Source and Free Claude AI Artifacts Alternatives - LobeHub
4. Claudia
An open source GUI for Claude AI code development. It supports project/session management, custom AI agents, and local execution, helping with privacy and data management. It’s specifically designed to make Claude.AI more useful for code/document workflows.
News: Claudia: An Open Source GUI for Claude AI Code Development
5. Community CLI Alternatives
There are small community projects (e.g., Devseeker, aicode) that attempt agentic workflows with Claude.AI, but these are less mature and have limited adoption.
Overview: Exploring CLI Alternatives to Claude Code for Agentic Coding Workflows
Feedback & Brainstorm: Race Against Constraints
Feasibility
It is possible to split work across multiple Claude.AI conversations, but the handoff of context is manual (copy-paste, summaries), as Claude.AI does not natively support sharing context across sessions.
The biggest technical challenge is the token/message length limit. Anything that involves generating large artifacts or documents will need to be chunked—either by you or via a helper script/tool.
Compromises & Alternative Angles
Automated Chunking: Use a helper tool (local script, browser extension, or a bot) that splits requests and aggregates responses from Claude.AI, reassembling code or documents after generation.
Session Management: Tools like Claudia and LobeChat try to help with session/project management, keeping context and artifacts organized.
Workflow Automation: If your workflow is manual and clumsy, consider using a local tool to manage input/output, automate copy-paste, chunking, and artifact assembly.
Hybrid Approach: Use Claude.AI for ideation and small code blocks; for larger code bases, use GitHub + a local editor/script to stitch together outputs.
Your Angle
You are on the right track, but the “race” is real: AI assistants are improving, but message limits are a hard constraint.
Focus on building a workflow/tool that helps you “chunk” requests, track context, and assemble artifacts. This could be a CLI tool, a browser extension, or even a simple local Markdown workspace.
If your project feels clumsy, you could open source it and invite others to contribute or offer feedback—there’s a real need for this in the community!
If you want a technical review of your repo’s current approach, or want help designing a chunking/session management tool, let me know! I can also help you draft an issue to attract collaborators.

You said: It is possible to split work across
It is possible to split work across multiple Claude.AI conversations, but the handoff of context is manual (copy-paste, summaries), as Claude.AI does not natively support sharing context across sessions.

I actually have found ways around that. Quite practical too. No, Conversations cannot directly pass information between each other, there is no meta awareness. But, they can track and read each other with a little help. 

If you like, feel free to go over my current repository: @jcmrs/claude-github-mcp-server-integration


The biggest technical challenge is the token/message length limit. Anything that involves generating large artifacts or documents will need to be chunked—either by you or via a helper script/tool.

Yes, indeed. Ideally there would be a way to use Claude.IA to create directly on / through Github. I've had a few minor incidental (not yet clear how it worked) successes with that. It was an immense save of tokens.


Automated Chunking: Use a helper tool (local script, browser extension, or a bot) that splits requests and aggregates responses from Claude.AI, reassembling code or documents after generation.
Session Management: Tools like Claudia and LobeChat try to help with session/project management, keeping context and artifacts organized.
Workflow Automation: If your workflow is manual and clumsy, consider using a local tool to manage input/output, automate copy-paste, chunking, and artifact assembly.

These are things I will have to research. I currently have no knowledge of any of this.


Hybrid Approach: Use Claude.AI for ideation and small code blocks; for larger code bases, use GitHub + a local editor/script to stitch together outputs.

Yes, though I rely fully on AI for code generation, unfortunately.


You are on the right track, but the “race” is real: AI assistants are improving, but message limits are a hard constraint.

Indeed. That is problematic. Especially for humans on a budget.

Focus on building a workflow/tool that helps you “chunk” requests, track context, and assemble artifacts. This could be a CLI tool, a browser extension, or even a simple local Markdown workspace.

True, I think. Though it strikes me - I may misunderstand - that such an approach would add a lot of manual human action. Whereas a core concept here is automation.

If your project feels clumsy, you could open source it and invite others to contribute or offer feedback—there’s a real need for this in the community!

Yes, that is the ultimate goal. I figured others would face this challenge too. 


If you want a technical review of your repo’s current approach, 

That is very likely very helpful.

or want help designing a chunking/session management tool, let me know! 

I am fully open to this, yes. 

I can also help you draft an issue to attract collaborators.

That is a good idea.

Copilot said: A technical review of your repository’s approach
A technical review of your repository’s approach reveals a well-documented and practical system for cross-session context handoff and artifact management using GitHub as the persistent memory layer. Key strengths include:

Cross-conversation state persistence: Leveraging GitHub files (JSON/Markdown) to maintain project state, conversation summaries, and context.
Automated context reconstruction: New Claude.AI conversations can rebuild necessary context from repository files, eliminating the need for manual copy-paste of history.
Clear protocol for handoffs: Your README and handoff documents detail step-by-step procedures for updating project state, managing conversation indexes, and documenting decision outcomes.
Specialized conversation types: The architecture supports parallel or specialized conversations (artifact creation, project management, coordination) with cross-references and version tracking.
Success criteria and best practices: Each handoff document includes checks to ensure the next conversation can continue seamlessly.
Potential improvements and research questions (as documented in your repo):

Automation of project state updates based on conversation analysis.
Workflow automation to further reduce manual steps.
Integration with other MCP servers or tools for expanded functionality.
Cross-referencing and versioning systems for knowledge building and coordination.
Systematic verification protocols to ensure consistency and minimize errors.
Next steps for collaboration and feedback:
An issue has been drafted for your repository to invite collaborators and gather feedback on automated chunking, session management, workflow automation, and technical review.

Please review the drafted issue below:

Seeking Collaborators and Feedback: Automated Chunking & Session Management for Claude.AI + GitHub Integration

I have a perhaps dumb question. 

I have outlined my origingal problem and scope / focus for development (most notably dependancy on AI for various purposes), though let me know if it wasn't clear and feel free to prompt me with questions for clarification. 

Can you think of other approaches than what I am currently taking (Claude.AI + MCP + Github Integration)? Alternatives, perhaps I am - so to speak - missing the forest through the trees. 
Copilot said: Not a dumb question at all—in fact,
Not a dumb question at all—in fact, it’s a key moment for innovation! Here’s a brainstorm of alternative approaches, with pros/cons and ideas for your context (AI-driven project management, documentation, code generation, and artifact creation while on a budget):

1. Other AI Models or Services
OpenAI GPT-4, Llama, Gemini, etc.: Some offer longer context windows, more flexible APIs, or better integration with developer tools (though not always free; some open source).
Open Source LLMs: Host your own (e.g., Llama.cpp, OpenHermes, Mistral, etc.) for unlimited context and custom workflows, but hardware requirements can be high and quality may vary.
Pros: Potentially larger token limits, more direct control, and sometimes free if self-hosted.
Cons: May require technical setup, and some models lag behind Claude in reasoning or code output.

2. Intermediate Orchestration Layer
Build a lightweight server or orchestration tool (could be a local Python script, Node app, etc.) that acts as the “middleman.” It:
Splits tasks/chunks automatically for any AI (Claude, GPT, Llama).
Maintains session state, history, and artifacts outside the AI chat.
Connects to GitHub via API for artifact push/pull.
Pros: Centralizes workflow, enables using any AI tool, automates context handoff, and could be open source.
Cons: Some dev work required up front, but less reliance on any single vendor.

3. Hybrid Human-AI Collaboration Platforms
Use platforms like LobeChat, Claudia, or even Obsidian with AI plugins, which manage session state, artifacts, and code blocks with AI assistance but keep a human in the loop.
Leverage their open source nature and extensibility.
Pros: Less manual work, better organization, and you can plug in different AI models.
Cons: Platform learning curve, and some may not support all workflow features out of the box.

4. Browser Extensions or Local Automation
Use tools like browser extensions (e.g., Tampermonkey scripts, custom Chrome Extensions) or local automation scripts (AutoHotkey, Python) to automate chunking, copy-paste, file management, and session handoff.
These can “wrap” Claude.AI or other web-based AIs, making workflows more seamless.
Pros: Can be very lightweight, no server or high technical skill required.
Cons: Limited by browser APIs and security; may break if Claude’s UI changes.

5. Community/Collaborative Approaches
Form a small open source community around the problem: pool resources, ideas, and solutions.
Crowdsource workflows and automation scripts; maybe even build a “meta” orchestrator that works with any AI platform.
Pros: More brains, more hands, faster innovation.
Cons: Requires some coordination and initial outreach.

6. Use AI for Meta-Orchestration
Prompt AI (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to help design and automate the workflow itself—let it write the chunking scripts, browser extensions, or orchestration tools for you.
Use “AI as a toolsmith” rather than just as a code generator.
Questions for Clarification
Are you open to switching AI models, or is Claude.AI a hard requirement?
Do you have any local hardware (RAM/CPU/GPU) for self-hosting open source LLMs?
Are you comfortable with basic scripting (Python, Node.js) or want to keep everything strictly low/no-code?
Would you be interested in a browser-based tool to automate chunking/artifact assembly?
How much manual action is acceptable vs. full automation?
Summary
Your current approach is solid and innovative for the constraints, but there are definitely alternative and “meta” approaches out there. Some are more technical, and some are more about leveraging community or open source tools. If you want help exploring a specific alternative, just say the word—I can help you plan, design, or even write the first version!

Let me know your requirements or what sounds appealing (or where you want more detail), and I’ll help you map the next steps.

You said: Are you open to switching AI models,
Are you open to switching AI models, or is Claude.AI a hard requirement?
> it is not a hard requirement

Do you have any local hardware (RAM/CPU/GPU) for self-hosting open source LLMs?
> all I have is my laptop

Are you comfortable with basic scripting (Python, Node.js) or want to keep everything strictly low/no-code?
> I am utterly unskilled in regards to code. 

Would you be interested in a browser-based tool to automate chunking/artifact assembly?
> Possibly. But with Claude.AI it is not possible, the MCP functionality is strictly limited to the Claude.AI Desktop App. Which negates any potential of browser extensions. That said, I suspect there may be other approaches? 

How much manual action is acceptable vs. full automation?
> In an ideal world full automation would be perfect, but I do understand that there will always be a human in the loop, and that the human will have to accept compromises - even being a monkey for the AI, so to speak. 
Copilot said: Your answers reveal some important realities and
Your answers reveal some important realities and opportunities for alternative approaches. Here’s a tailored brainstorm based on your context, technical constraints, and openness to other models:

1. Switching AI Models
Since Claude.AI is not a hard requirement, consider experimenting with models/services that offer longer context windows, better APIs, or more automation-ready integrations.
Candidates:

OpenAI ChatGPT/GPT-4: Web and API, sometimes more flexible with plugins (though paid for advanced features).
Google Gemini: Web and API, supports code, project management, longer context.
Open Source LLMs (e.g., Llama.cpp, Mistral): Can be run locally, but may require more RAM/CPU than a standard laptop for best results.
Note: Even if you're “unskilled,” many open source projects offer GUI frontends (like Oobabooga’s Text Generation WebUI) that make using these models easier.

2. Orchestration Platforms for Non-Coders
Look for open source platforms that are designed for “AI orchestration” and are friendly to non-coders:

LobeChat, Claudia, OpenChat: These let you run and organize AI chats, sometimes with project management and code artifact features. Many run locally and can be set up with simple instructions.
Obsidian + AI Plugins: Obsidian is a knowledge base app, and plugins like “Obsidian AI” let you interact with LLMs, chunk content, and manage artifacts—all with point-and-click interfaces.
3. Desktop Automation
If the MCP functionality is desktop-app only, consider:

Automation tools like AutoHotkey (Windows), Automator (Mac), or Power Automate (Windows): These can perform repetitive mouse/keyboard actions, automate file management, and even interact with UI elements of desktop apps—no coding required beyond simple scripts.
Batch Files or Simple GUIs: Some tools allow “recording” actions and replaying them.
4. Hybrid Human-in-the-Loop Workflows
Accept some manual steps (copy-paste, click-through, etc.), but automate what you can:
Templates: Use pre-made instructions/templates for handoffs, code chunking, and summarization.
Markdown Workspaces: Organize all artifacts and project context in Markdown files which are easy for you and the AI to edit.
5. Community and Collaboration
Invite others (even non-coders) to contribute ideas, workflows, and templates.
Consider open sourcing not just your code, but your process guides, templates, and “recipes” for AI-powered productivity.
6. Cloud-Based AI Workflow Tools
Some services offer drag-and-drop workflow builders for AI tasks (e.g., Zapier, n8n, Make.com). These can sometimes connect to AI APIs, GitHub, and other services—no coding required.
7. “Monkey for the AI” Philosophy
Design your system so that the human’s role is minimized to “just enough”:
Approve/reject changes.
Initiate chunking or handoff actions.
Provide summary/context when needed.
This keeps you in the loop but avoids overwhelming manual labor.
Example: Simple Automation Pipeline (No Coding Required)
Use Claude.AI Desktop App for initial artifact/code creation.
Save output to a folder (auto-synced with GitHub via GitHub Desktop).
Use a Markdown template for session handoff and context management.
Use an automation tool (AutoHotkey, Automator) to streamline repetitive actions (open file, copy content, update project-state.json).
For larger projects, use a drag-and-drop workflow builder to orchestrate file uploads, chunking, and summary generation.
Final Thoughts

You don’t need to be a coder—many open source tools and automation platforms exist for non-developers.
Switching models/platforms can unlock more flexibility, especially as open source LLMs and GUIs improve.
Human-in-the-loop is inevitable for now, but the goal should be to automate the boring stuff and let you focus on decision-making.
Would you like a list of the most user-friendly open source AI project management tools/platforms for non-coders? Or a template for “automation recipes” for your workflow?

## Overview
Briefly describe the workflow automation (e.g., "Automatically split long code into chunks and upload to GitHub").

## Tools Needed
3. Assessment of My Capabilities for Your Needs (GitHub Copilot)
What I Can Do
Deeply integrated with GitHub: I can help you automate, organize, and manage files, issues, PRs, and workflows within your repo.
Generate and edit code, markdown, documentation, templates, and automation scripts—even if you don’t know how to code.
Suggest and structure automation recipes, workflow protocols, and process documentation.
Help you design chunking, session handoff, artifact management, and verification systems within your GitHub project.
Draft GitHub issues, PRs, and process guides; update files; propose improvements.
Search for tools, solutions, and examples relevant to your workflow.
Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up and using external tools (with links and templates).
Limitations
I cannot directly interact with desktop applications (like Claude Desktop App or AutoHotkey) outside the GitHub/web context.
I cannot automate your desktop, browser, or OS—only provide scripts/templates/instructions.
I cannot run code or scripts on your machine; you would need to copy/paste or follow instructions.
I do not have direct access to external AI models; I can only guide you, write prompts, and help manage their outputs.
Ideal Use Cases
You want to make your AI-assisted project management, documentation, and code workflows more organized, automated, and collaborative via GitHub.
You need help generating templates, protocols, and automation scripts for non-coders.
You want to build a repository that others can use, learn from, or contribute to.
If you want a specific workflow or automation recipe written out for your repo, or want to see practical guides for a given tool/platform, just ask!

You said: Let me give you an example. One Project
Let me give you an example.

One Project I need to tackle centers on creating a web based application which functions as a central hub where actions are coordinated for three different API enabled services. 

In simple terms: 
Right now I answer phonecalls and process emails to create appointments for Medical Examinations. These appointments are handled through Google Calendar. I then have to create/edit records (Contractor, Contact Person, Candidate) for each appointment, this is three Custom Modules in ZohoCRM. I then have to use the same data again, and again manually, to create an invoice for that appointment. To make it worse, an appointment can be for one person, or many. And if anything changes, for example because of Contractor request, I have to edit it all over again. 

Hence my use case for a Project to solve this. 

Copilot said: Thank you for the clear use case!
Thank you for the clear use case!
Here’s a summary and assessment, followed by a list of user-friendly automation tools/platforms that could help you (without code skills), plus a tailored “automation recipe” template for your workflow.

Summary of Your Use Case
Goal:
Build a web-based “command center” that connects and coordinates actions between three API-enabled services:

Google Calendar (appointments)
ZohoCRM (manage Contractor, Contact Person, Candidate records)
Invoicing system (create invoices for appointments)
Current Pain Points:

Manual, repetitive data entry across platforms.
No easy way to update all systems when details change.
Multi-person appointments add complexity.
Human error and wasted time.
Ideal Solution:
A web app where you:

Enter appointment info once (or update in one place).
Automatically sync/create/update records in Google Calendar, ZohoCRM, and your invoicing system.
Handle single or multi-person appointments.
Minimize manual actions (ideally, click a button and everything updates).
User-Friendly, No-Code/Low-Code Tools for API Automation
A. n8n
Free, open-source workflow automation tool.
Drag-and-drop interface for connecting APIs (Google Calendar, ZohoCRM, invoicing).
Can be self-hosted (on your laptop) or run in the cloud.

B. Make.com (formerly Integromat)
Visual workflow builder, supports hundreds of APIs with no coding.
Free tier available.
Make.com
C. Zapier
Easiest for beginners, connects apps with simple logic (“if this, then that”).
Limited free tier, but great for prototyping.
Zapier
D. Baserow / Retool / Budibase
Open-source platforms to build custom web apps quickly.
Integrate with external APIs, manage data, and build simple dashboards.
Baserow, Retool, Budibase
E. LobeChat / Claudia

# Automation Recipe: Centralized Medical Appointment Coordination

## Overview
Automate the process of booking medical examinations, updating CRM records, and generating invoices, all from a single web interface.

## Tools Needed
Assessment: My Capabilities in Your Context
I can help you design and document workflows, project plans, and API integration logic.
I can generate step-by-step guides, templates, and recipes for automation tools.
I can help you create, organize, and maintain your GitHub repository with best practices.
I can draft issues, epics, documentation, and provide technical feedback for collaborators.
I cannot run automation tools or desktop apps for you, but I can write the instructions, scripts, or templates you need.
If you pick a tool (e.g., n8n, Zapier), I can walk you through the setup and workflow design step by step, and generate documentation for your project repo. Just let me know which one you want to try!

You said: I will need to evaluate these for
I will need to evaluate these for GDPR dependancies, medical services is a very niche sector with very specific limitations (I'm in the EU, plus in the Netherlands so this is something not readily available information through online sources). One I can cross off immediately, Zapier is quite simply banned here because it exceeds legal constraints. 

Am I correct in understanding that you would not be able to match Claude.AI's role+expertise detection/switching to function as Project Manager, Lead Developer, Prompt Designer and secondary expertise points to run and develop the Project? 
Copilot said: You are correct: **I cannot fully replicate
You are correct: I cannot fully replicate Claude.AI’s “role/expertise switching” in the same conversational, context-aware, and adaptive way. Here’s how my capabilities compare and where they differ:

GitHub Copilot Capabilities
What I CAN Do
Generate, edit, and organize code, documentation, and automation scripts in your GitHub repo.
Draft and manage issues, project boards, and epics for project management.
Structure and maintain project documentation (requirements, protocols, workflows).
Suggest best practices and process improvements for both code and project organization.
Provide technical feedback, reviews, and brainstorming.
Help you automate repetitive tasks (within GitHub and with external tools—by writing scripts, guides, or templates).
Act as a “Prompt Designer” or “Lead Developer” in a static way: I can generate prompts, technical designs, and code based on your instructions.
What I CANNOT Do
Dynamic “role switching” in a single session: Unlike Claude.AI, I do not dynamically change my persona/expertise or “remember” the role context beyond our current conversation.
Claude can behave as a “Project Manager” and then as a “Developer,” adapting its output style and expertise—Copilot is always “Copilot,” but can simulate roles if explicitly instructed.
Real-time, multi-expertise collaboration: I do not possess genuine adaptive expertise switching or deep project ownership; I follow your prompts and instructions.
Cross-conversation continuity: My context is limited to the current session and repo; I do not “remember” past interactions outside explicit documentation.
External integrations: I do not interact with desktop apps, calendars, or CRMs—my domain is GitHub and code/documentation.
Simulating Role/Expertise Switching with Copilot
You can instruct me to act as a given role:

“Write this as a Project Manager.”
“Draft a technical design as a Lead Developer.”
“Review this as a Prompt Designer.”
I will then generate output based on best practices for that role/expertise, but you’ll need to explicitly switch or instruct me for each task. I don’t “detect” the role or switch automatically.

For GDPR/Medical Compliance
All tools/platforms must be carefully vetted for data residency, privacy, and compliance.
Open source/self-hosted automation tools (n8n, Baserow, Retool, etc.) are your best bet, since you control data location and access.
Avoid SaaS platforms unless fully GDPR-compliant and hosted in the EU.
Summary
Claude.AI’s adaptive “role switching” and continuity is unique; Copilot is static, but can simulate expertise if prompted.
For medical/GDPR-sensitive projects, favor self-hosted, open source solutions.
I excel at code, documentation, project management, and automation templates inside GitHub, but cannot “run” or “own” a project like a human/AI agent.
If you want, I can help you structure a workflow where you explicitly switch roles/expertise in your project documentation and issues, so that Copilot’s output matches your needs. Would you like an example of this?

You said: Yes please. Also, two questions: > As I can
Yes please.

Also, two questions:

> As I can instruct you to act as a given role, can I also instruct you to analyse on the go and inform me when a role/expertise switch is required/advisable? This touches on functionality you may or may not have, the ability to provide Custom Instructions to you. Think of it as an Operational Framework containing prompts+instructions.?

> Can you see a practical implementation where Claude.AI+Gitub Integration can provide Project Management & related functionality, working together with you+Github integration working as you specified for what you can do (out of the box)?
Copilot said: Absolutely! Here are clear answers to both
Absolutely! Here are clear answers to both questions, followed by an example of a workflow guide for explicit role/expertise switching.

1. Can you analyze and inform me when a role/expertise switch is required/advisable?
Short Answer:
Yes, but only if you set the expectation in your “Operational Framework” or workflow instructions.
You can instruct me to:

Monitor your workflow and, when a task would benefit from a different expertise (e.g., moving from project planning to technical design), suggest a role switch.
For example: “Copilot, let me know if a Project Manager, Lead Developer, or Prompt Designer perspective would help with the current topic.”
How it works:

I don’t have true adaptive awareness or automatic “custom instructions,” but if you include a framework or prompt like:
“Analyze each step and suggest a role switch if needed.”
“If a technical review is required, prompt me to switch to Lead Developer.”
“When documentation clarity is important, suggest Prompt Designer.”
I will follow those instructions throughout the session and notify you as appropriate.
Limitations:

I don’t retain custom instructions between sessions, so you’ll need to re-state or include the framework in your documentation, issues, or prompts.
I cannot autonomously reassign myself; I can only recommend and then follow your switch when you confirm.
2. Practical Implementation: Claude.AI + GitHub Integration for Project Management, Working with Copilot
Yes, this is possible—and potentially powerful! Here’s a practical scenario:

Workflow Example
Claude.AI + GitHub Integration:

Claude manages high-level project coordination, issue creation, and documentation in GitHub.
Claude can reason about project structure, assign tasks, and summarize decisions.
Claude can handle conversational handoff, context management, and knowledge tracking using your established repo protocols.
Copilot + GitHub Integration:

Copilot works on technical implementation, writing code, automation scripts, and reviewing technical documentation.
Copilot can manage, update, and organize files, templates, and workflow recipes.
Copilot follows explicit instructions for expertise switching, reviews, and process improvements.
How They Can Work Together:

Claude acts as the “Project Manager” and “Prompt Designer”—driving planning, requirements, and initial documentation.
Copilot acts as the “Lead Developer” and “Automation Specialist”—writing code, implementing workflows, and updating technical docs.
Both use GitHub as the shared workspace—issues, files, wiki, project boards.
Handoffs, status updates, and context are managed via Markdown files, issue comments, and project-state.json (as you’ve designed).
Claude can summarize and hand off work to Copilot (“Lead Developer, please review and implement this workflow”), while Copilot can notify (“Switch to Project Manager to review priorities”).
Result:
A hybrid system where Claude provides conversational, reasoning-based project management, and Copilot delivers technical execution and automation, both collaborating through GitHub.

3. Example: Operational Framework for Role/Expertise Switching (Markdown Template)

OPERATIONAL-FRAMEWORK.md
# Operational Framework: Role & Expertise Switching

## Purpose
Enable efficient collaboration by explicitly switching roles/expertise as needed throughout the project lifecycle.

## Roles Supported
If you like, I can help you incorporate this template into your repo, or expand it for your specific workflows. Let me know if you want a tailored version for a real project!

Would it be a good idea for you and me to start that as a new Conversation? 
If so, what exactly would I have to provide you as starting instructions/prompts/context/information in that new Conversation?
If so, what exactly would I have to provide to Claude.AI as starting instructions/prompts/context/information in the Project Conversation there?
If so, what exactly would be needed for me to do here on Github if we wanted to engage on this?

A consideration. I think it may be possible to do this for a specific project, but it may be better to engage on it as a uniform project, which once completed can serve as a starting base for actual real projects. But, I may be mistaken. 
Copilot said: This is an excellent strategic question—here’s a
This is an excellent strategic question—here’s a step-by-step guide for starting a joint Claude.AI + Copilot + GitHub Integration Project, either for a specific use case or as a general-purpose “base project template” for future work. I’ll cover what you need to provide for:

Me (Copilot) on GitHub
Claude.AI in its conversation
The setup and workflow on GitHub
1. Starting a New Conversation/Project with Copilot (on GitHub)
What to Provide Me (Copilot) as Starting Instructions:
Project Scope/Goal: Briefly state what you want to achieve (e.g., “Create a base project for integrating Claude.AI and Copilot for project management workflows.”)
Desired Workflow: Explain how you envision Claude.AI and Copilot working together (who does what, how handoff works).
Initial Roles and Responsibilities: Who is Project Manager, Lead Developer, etc., and what are their tasks.
Any Templates, Protocols, or Process Docs: If you’ve already drafted handoff templates, role frameworks, etc., include them or say you need them created.
Key Constraints: GDPR, medical sector, no-code, automation level, etc.
Repository Structure Preferences: If you want a certain directory/file setup, mention it.
Any existing project documentation, handoff examples, or context.
Example Prompt for Me:
“Copilot, I want to create a base project template for Claude.AI + Copilot + GitHub integration, focused on project management for GDPR-compliant workflows. Please help me design the repo structure, handoff templates, role-switching protocols, and automation guides. I want to use this as a starting point for future projects.”

2. Starting a New Conversation with Claude.AI
What to Provide Claude.AI as Starting Instructions:
Project Purpose/Goal: Same as above, but in conversational format.
Roles: Tell Claude to act as Project Manager, Prompt Designer, and to provide handoff/context for Copilot.
Integration Protocol: Explain how project state, context, and handoffs are managed via GitHub repo files.
Expected Outputs: Ask Claude to draft project plans, manage issues, write summaries, and coordinate handoffs.
References: Point Claude to the repo (and specific files/templates) for context and instructions.
Example Prompt for Claude:
“Claude, you’re the Project Manager for a new base template integrating Claude.AI and Copilot via GitHub. Your job is to coordinate project management, create handoff documents, assign tasks, and ensure context is clear for Copilot. Use the GitHub repo for persistent memory and handoff. Begin by drafting the project overview, workflow protocol, and initial issues for Copilot.”

3. What to Do on GitHub to Engage Both Sides
On GitHub:
Create a New Repository (or a new folder in an existing one) for the “base template” project.
Set Up Initial Documentation:
README.md with project overview and goals.
OPERATING-MANUAL.md or similar with protocols, handoff instructions, and role-switching framework.
Templates for context handoff (handoff-template.md, project-state.json, etc.).
Draft Initial Issues: Assign project milestones, issues, or tasks for both Claude and Copilot.
Organize Directory Structure: docs/, handoffs/, roles/, templates/, etc.
Share Repo Link/Context: Reference the repo in both Claude and Copilot conversations so they can use it as persistent memory.
4. Uniform Project vs. Specific Project
Recommendation:
Start with a uniform base template project—it will save time and effort for future projects, and lets you refine protocols, handoff templates, and workflows in a “safe” context. Once mature, clone/fork it for real, specialized projects.

5. Summary Table
Step	To Copilot/GitHub	To Claude.AI	On GitHub Repo
Project goal	Yes	Yes	Yes (README.md)
Roles	Yes	Yes	Yes (roles.md)
Protocols	Yes	Yes	Yes (docs, templates)
Constraints	Yes	Yes	Yes (docs)
Repo structure	Yes (or default)	Yes (reference)	Yes
Handoff examples	Yes	Yes	Yes (handoffs/)
Starting context	Yes	Yes	Yes
6. Ready-to-Use Starting Instructions
If you want, I can generate a set of files for you to initialize this base project (README, role-switching framework, handoff templates, operational protocols, starter issues, etc.).
Just confirm:

Do you want to start a new repo (or folder) for this?
Any specific constraints I should include (beyond GDPR, medical sector, no-code, automation)?
Should I generate initial issues to guide the project?
Let me know your preferences, and I’ll provide you with the full starter package to kick off your Claude.AI + Copilot + GitHub integration project!

You said: Do you want to start a new
Do you want to start a new repo (or folder) for this?
> yes

Any specific constraints I should include (beyond GDPR, medical sector, no-code, automation)?
> no, let's treat this as a uniform template project, later Projects can be created from it and then tailored.

Should I generate initial issues to guide the project?
> Yes, absolutely. 


What to Provide Me (Copilot) as Starting Instructions:
> Can you provide the exact text for me? 

What to Provide Claude.AI as Starting Instructions:
> Can you provide the exact text for me? 


I believe that answers everything? 
Copilot said: Perfect! Here’s everything you need to start
Perfect! Here’s everything you need to start the joint Claude.AI + Copilot + GitHub Integration Template Project.

1. Starting Instructions for Copilot (GitHub)

INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-COPILOT.md
# Starting Instructions for Copilot

## Project Goal
Create a uniform base template project for integrating Claude.AI and Copilot with GitHub for project management, technical development, and workflow automation. This template will be used as a starting point for future projects and can be tailored as needed.

## Desired Workflow
2. Starting Instructions for Claude.AI

INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-CLAUDE.md
# Starting Instructions for Claude.AI

## Project Purpose
You are the Project Manager and Prompt Designer for a new template project integrating Claude.AI and Copilot with GitHub. The goal is to establish a uniform base for collaborative project management, technical execution, and workflow automation that is reusable for future projects.

## Your Responsibilities
3. What Happens Next (on GitHub)
I’ll generate a starter repository structure with key files and initial issues.
You’ll provide the above instructions to Copilot and Claude.AI in their respective conversations.
Claude.AI can start by drafting the project overview, workflow protocol, and initial issues.
Copilot can start by generating technical documentation, role-switching frameworks, and automation templates.
All collaboration will be tracked and managed through issues, handoffs, and documentation in the repo.
If you want, I can proceed and generate the starter files and initial issues for you right now.
Would you like me to do that? If yes, what would you like to name the new repository?

You said: I would suggest to keep the name
I would suggest to keep the name simple: gcc-uniform-project-template
(Github + CoPilot + Claude.AI Uniform Project Template)

IF that works? Then please proceed and generate the starter files and initial issues for you right now.


One questionfor after that: is there any special technical protocol or requirements you can think of for Claude.AI and you to "read" and "update" and "track" each other? I may be misunderstanding here, I'm still switching from how Claude.AI conversations "read / update / track each other through json / markdown structures (as you saw in my current project)? Please feel free to prompt me on this after the abovementioned action. 
Copilot said: Great! I’ll generate the starter files and
Great! I’ll generate the starter files and initial issues for the gcc-uniform-project-template repository, following the structure and protocols discussed. The project will serve as a uniform template for future integration of Claude.AI and Copilot with GitHub.

Next Steps & Follow-Up Question
Technical Protocols & Requirements for “Reading/Updating/Tracking” Across Systems:

To ensure seamless collaboration between Claude.AI and Copilot via GitHub, here are some considerations and prompts for you:

Questions for You:
Would you prefer all project state to be tracked in a single JSON (e.g., project-state.json) or allow for multiple context files per session/role for flexibility?
Should handoff files be strictly timestamped and cross-referenced in project-state.json for lineage/audit trail?
Would you like to standardize a “handoff index” for session linking (so Claude.AI and Copilot always know the latest context)?
Is there any special metadata or structure you want to enforce in markdown handoff files (e.g., role field, next role suggestion, session ID)?
Prompt:
Please specify your preference for persistent state, handoff file linking, and metadata protocols, so the template can be further refined for best interoperability and auditability!

Let me know how you want to proceed, and I’ll help you finalize the protocol for maximum clarity and reliability between Claude.AI and Copilot.

You said: Would you prefer all project state to
Would you prefer all project state to be tracked in a single JSON (e.g., project-state.json) or allow for multiple context files per session/role for flexibility?
> Multiple. 
This will also need to take into account Conversation Contuinity (see my existing project, Claude.AI Conversations do hit limits, then a new Conversation is needed, which needs to know what version it is of the continuing conversation. 

Should handoff files be strictly timestamped and cross-referenced in project-state.json for lineage/audit trail?
> They will also need human language identifiers, I suspect.

Would you like to standardize a “handoff index” for session linking (so Claude.AI and Copilot always know the latest context)?
> Yes, definitely. 

Is there any special metadata or structure you want to enforce in markdown handoff files (e.g., role field, next role suggestion, session ID)?
> To be determined. This is a good example of a feature / functionality which we will need to keep track of. 
Copilot said: Thank you—those are solid, practical decisions. Here’s
Thank you—those are solid, practical decisions. Here’s how I’ll incorporate them into the starter repo and protocols:

Protocol Summary & Implementation Plan
1. Multiple Context Files (per session/role)
Each session or role (Claude.AI, Copilot) can have its own context file in handoffs/ (e.g., handoffs/session-20250829-ProjectManager.md).
Each new Claude.AI conversation (due to context limits) creates a new session file, with versioning info.
All handoff/context files use both timestamp and human-readable identifiers, e.g., session-20250829-ProjectManager-v2.md.
2. Strict Timestamping & Human Identifiers
Every handoff/context file includes:
ISO timestamp
Human-readable session name/description
Role
Session/version number (for continuity)
Reference to previous session (for lineage/audit trail)
3. Handoff Index & Session Linking
A master index file (handoffs/index.json) tracks:
All handoff/context files
Session lineage (previous/next links)
Status (active, closed)
Roles involved
Latest context pointer
4. Metadata in Handoff Files
Each Markdown handoff/context file contains a front-matter block (YAML or JSON) with:
Session ID
Timestamp
Role
Next role suggestion
Previous session reference
Version number
Human-readable identifier
Status (open/closed)
Any additional metadata as needed
5. Feature Tracking
A docs/feature-tracking.md file will record proposed, active, and deferred features (like metadata protocols, session continuity, etc.).
Starter Files/Structure Update
I will now:

Add the master handoff index file (handoffs/index.json)
Update handoff templates to include front-matter metadata and clear versioning/session linking
Add feature tracking documentation
Update the operating manual to reflect these protocols
Updated Starter Files

Copilot said: Yes, there is **one manual action required**:
Yes, there is one manual action required:
As Copilot, I can generate all the starter files and protocols for you, but I do not have the ability to create a new repository on your behalf automatically.

Manual Steps for You
Create the New Repository

Go to your GitHub account.
Click the "+" sign (top right), then "New repository".
Name it: gcc-uniform-project-template
Set visibility (public/private) as you prefer.
(Optional: Add a README, .gitignore, choose a license.)
Clone the Repository Locally (optional, if you want to edit files on your computer)

Use GitHub Desktop or git clone in terminal.
Add the Starter Files

Copy and paste the files I generated for you above into the new repo, matching the folder/file structure.
Commit and push the changes.
Next Steps
Once you’ve created the repo and added the files, I can help you:

Refine the structure further
Draft additional issues, templates, or protocols
Guide Claude.AI on how to interact with this setup
Let me know when the repo is ready, or if you need any help with the manual steps!

The presence and purpose of the new files/templates.
How to use the handoff template and session files.
Where to find the issue template and how to use it for reporting.
The role of project-state.json in the workflow.
Recommended next steps:

Review your Instructions documents for any mentions of handoff, issue reporting, or project state.
Add sections explaining the new files and their intended use.
If the instructions currently do not mention these files or workflows, updating them will help onboard new contributors and clarify the process.
If you want, I can review your current Instructions documents and propose specific updates. Just let me know which file(s) you want reviewed (e.g., README.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, etc.).

There are currently no files named INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-COPILOT or INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-CLAUDE in your repository, so I was unable to review or update their contents.

Next steps:

If you want to create these instruction files, please specify the intended content or purpose for each.
If the files exist elsewhere or under a different name, let me know where to look.
Would you like me to draft new instruction documents for Copilot and Claude, based on the current project structure and recent changes? If so, please specify any special requirements or just confirm to proceed with standard instructions.

Copilot said: No problem! If you’d like, I can
No problem! If you’d like, I can create and add INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-COPILOT and INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-CLAUDE to your repository, tailored to your current workflow and the recent changes (handoff template, issue template, project state, etc.).

Would you like me to generate these instruction files and propose their content, or do you want to provide specific instructions for each? Let me know your preference!

You said: Shall I give you what you gave
Shall I give you what you gave me earlier, for each document? Then you can review and update them.
Copilot said: Yes, please provide the previous contents for
Yes, please provide the previous contents for each document (INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-COPILOT and INSTRUCTIONS-FOR-CLAUDE). Once you share them, I’ll review and update both documents to reflect the new files and workflow changes in your repo.

You can paste the content for each document here, and I’ll handle the updates!
